# Pepewagon

A platform that incentives users that contribute to open source street and traffic data.

## About Pepewagon

Pepewagon - aims to ensure that street and traffic data are up-to-date by incentivizing the general public to contribute towards the open source dataset.

With our "Map to Earn" model, we aim to onboard not only existing ecosystem members but people who are external towards Web3 and the blockchain scene.

By incentivizing users when they contribute map data, we are able to turn:

- Daily walks to potential earning opportunities
- Travels into meaningful discoveries
- Users to digital street adventurers
